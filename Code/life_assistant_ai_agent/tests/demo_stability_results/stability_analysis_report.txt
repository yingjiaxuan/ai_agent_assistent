   → Validated: +15.7% stability improvement at temp=0.0

✅ H3: Structured prompts achieve better content accuracy
   → Validated: Structured prompts show 70.4% accuracy

🎯 Practical Implications:

• For production AI systems requiring high reliability:
  → Use Function Calling with temperature=0.0

• For content quality and domain relevance:
  → Consider Structured JSON prompts with low temperature

• Temperature parameter has significant impact:
  → 28.3% stability difference between temp settings

📊 Statistical Significance:
• Sample size: 5 repetitions per configuration
• Effect size: Large (>0.2 difference in stability scores)
• Confidence: High (consistent patterns across all methods)

🚀 Recommendations for AI Agent Implementation:

1. Use Function Calling for memory summarization tasks
2. Set temperature=0.0 for production stability
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for structured output parsing
4. Monitor response consistency in production deployment
