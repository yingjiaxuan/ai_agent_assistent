ðŸ“… Analysis Date: 2025-07-10 06:25:23
ðŸ“‹ Sample Size: 6 configurations

ðŸŽ¯ KEY FINDINGS:
---------------
â€¢ Most Stable Method: Function Calling (Score: 0.832)
â€¢ Most Accurate Method: Structured JSON (Score: 0.704)
â€¢ Temperature Stability Effect: Cohen's d = 0.827
â€¢ Temperature Accuracy Effect: Cohen's d = 2.055

ðŸ“ˆ RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------
1. For production systems: Use Function Calling with temperature=0.0
2. For content quality: Consider Structured JSON prompts
3. Always use low temperature for stability
4. Monitor consistency in deployment

ðŸ“Š STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
---------------------------
â€¢ All observed effects show large effect sizes (d > 0.5)
â€¢ Temperature parameter has consistent impact across methods
â€¢ Function calling shows superior consistency
â€¢ Results support theoretical predictions
